# Tili-Tiikeri - Automating Accounting with AI
_Building AI course project_

## Summary
Project Tili-Tiikeri is an AI-driven platform aimed at automating accounting tasks for small to medium-sized businesses.

## Background
Bookkeeping is a time-consuming and repetitive process that requires attention to detail. Small businesses, in particular, struggle with efficient bookkeeping due to limited resources and expertise. As an ERP Consultant, I have observed the challenges faced by businesses and accountants, and it is my mission to alleviate their burden. Project Tili-Tiikeri aims to automate daily tasks, reducing human error, and freeing up valuable time for more strategic activities.

## Data and AI Techniques
To build a comprehensive AI-based accounting solution, we will rely on data sources such as general ledger data, invoices and payment data. The system will be trained on a vast dataset of anonymized and aggregated financial records to identify patterns and learn best practices. Techniques like natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and deep learning algorithms will be employed to interpret data, categorize transactions, and generate accurate financial reports.

## How is it Used
Project Tili-Tiikeri is designed for small to medium-sized businesses. The AI-powered platform will integrate with Microsoft Business Central. Features will be configured according to customers needs. Functionality itself is modular, it can be made step by step incrementally.

## Challenges
Project Tili-Tiikeri is not without limitations. While it can automate many bookkeeping tasks, it may struggle to interpret complex or ambiguous transactions. Additionally, the AI may require ongoing training and customization to adapt to evolving regulations and business requirements. Human oversight will still be necessary to ensure accuracy and compliance.

## What Next
To enhance the capabilities of Project Tili-Tiikeri, we envision adding features such as fraud detection, tax optimization, and financial forecasting.
